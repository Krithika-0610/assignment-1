    <h2>Becoming a Photographer</h2>
    <p>Photography is more than just clicking a shutter. It’s the art of seeing beauty in everyday moments. My dream is to become a professional photographer who tells real stories through powerful visuals—from portraits to nature, street to studio. With each frame, I want to inspire emotions, conversations, and creativity in others.</p>
    <p>Join me as I chase my dream—one snapshot at a time.</p>
